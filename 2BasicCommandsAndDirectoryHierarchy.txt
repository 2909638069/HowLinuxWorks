This chapter is a guide to the Unix commands and utilities.
Why Unix commands? Linux is a Unix flavor at heart.

2.1 The Bourne Shell: /bin/sh
A shell is a program that runs commands, and it also serves as a small programming environment.
Shell scripts are text files that contain a sequence of shell commands.
The bash shell is the default shell on most Linux distributions.

2.2.1 The Shell Window
A single $ denotes the shell prompt. A single # denotes that you should run as the superuser (root).

2.2.2 cat
  $ cat file1 file2 ...
cat (concatenate) prints the contents of file1, file2, and any other files, and then exits.

2.2.3 Standard Input and Standard output (I/O)
Unix processes use I/O streams to read and write data. Streams are very flexible.
One of the best features of stadard streams is that they can easily be manipulated to read and
write to places other than the terminal.

2.3 Basic Commands

2.3.1 ls
The ls command lists the contents of a directory. The default is the current directory.
Use ls -l for a detailed (long) listing.

2.3.2 cp
The cp command copies files.
  $ cp file1 file2
  $ cp file1 file2 ... fileN dir

2.3.3 mv
The mv commands move files.
  $ mv file1 file2
  $ mv file1 file2 ... fileN dir

2.3.4 touch
The touch command creates a file. If the file already exists, touch updates the file's
modification time stamp.

2.3.5 rm
To remove a file, use rm.

2.3.6 echo
The echo command prints its arguments to the standard output.
